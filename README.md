# PKCodeChallenge
Front end Code Challenge by ParkeringsKompagniet


I was quite new to React and Typescript. 
So i basically used most of my saturday to go through crash courses in react and TypeScript.
With this and and some googeling to solve issues in the middle of the 3 hours challenge, i have then come to make this solution. 
There is still more i want to do, but my 3 hours is up.

So given my low experience with React, it was pretty hard to figure out, what i could use to make what. 

Forexample 
Figuring out how to get the search history to work, took me about an hour and left me with no time, 
to figure out how to get my onclick event to show another page, without reloading the page. 
Such that i could show the chosen coin, with more details.
Right now, if you click on a coin, it will show you an empty coin info page.
Ontop of this, because the page is reloaded, the page forget the search history, as its not saved in some cookie or session.
